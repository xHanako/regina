                    Welcome to the Regina Angelorum convent church, one of the oldest and most unique temples in 
                    the Colonial City of Santo Domingo.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This enclosure, located on the corner of Padre Billini and José Reyes streets, was the first female 
                    convent established in the island and one of the earliest cloistered spaces for nuns in the New 
                    World. Its history dates back to the mid-sixteenth century, in the founding years of the city.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the arrival of the first male religious orders – Franciscans, Mercedarians and Dominicans – 
                    the need arose to create female communities that would offer spiritual and social protection to 
                    young women and widows in the neighborhood. In 1556, a group of notable neighbors asked 
                    King Philip II to found a monastery of Dominican nuns. In response, in 1560 the first six nuns 
                    arrived in Santo Domingo, and shortly afterwards the construction of this temple, dedicated to 
                    Regina Angelorum or Mary, Queen of the Angels, was ordered.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The construction was possible thanks to the extraordinary generosity of María de Arana, a pious 
                    Spanish lady and widow of a wealthy landowner from El Seibo, who sold her goods and donated 
                    her fortune to build the church and convent. His gesture forever marked the history of Regina 
                    Angelorum.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now  look  up  at  one  of  the  most  extraordinary  elements  of  the  temple:  its brick dome, in 
                    Renaissance-Baroque style, raised on pendentives and pierced by skylights that allow natural 
                    light to pass through. Regina Angelorum is one of only two colonial churches in Santo Domingo 
                    that have a dome, along with the old church of the Jesuits, today the National Pantheon, which 
                    makes it an exceptional architectural piece within the colonial complex.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice also the high wooden choir, which was accessed directly from the convent. This structure 
                    is  original  from  the colonial period and is considered the oldest preserved wooden choir in 
                    America. From here, the cloistered nuns participated in the liturgical celebrations, when they did 
                    not do so through the Mudejar-inspired latticework, maintaining the privacy of conventual life.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this convent lived women of great intellectual and spiritual sensitivity. Among them stands out 
                    Sister Leonor de Ovando, considered one of the first Creole poets of the American continent, 
                    along with Elvira de Mendoza. Their early voices constitute an invaluable legacy of the written 
                    culture on the island. <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    En  este  convento  vivieron  mujeres  de  gran  sensibilidad  intelectual  y  espiritual.  Entre  ellas 
                    destaca sor Leonor de Ovando, considerada una de las primeras poetisas criollas del continente 
                    americano, junto a Elvira de Mendoza. Sus voces tempranas constituyen un legado invaluable de 
                    la cultura escrita en la isla.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turn your attention now to the high altar. The temple has two remarkable Baroque wooden 
                    altarpieces, the main one being dedicated to the invocation of the Queen of Angels. In it there is 
                    a Marian image of dress, typical of the Spanish eighteenth century. The front of the altar, made of 
                    embossed silver, is one of the most refined pieces of the set. According to tradition, during the 
                    invasion of the city by the English pirate Francis Drake in 1586, the nuns painted this silver 
                    frontal  black  to  hide its value and prevent it from being looted, demonstrating genious and 
                    bravery in times of danger. <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story of Regina Angelorum is also deeply linked to Father Francisco Xavier Billini, a priest 
                    of Italian origin and a central figure of Dominican charity in the nineteenth century. In 1877, 
                    after the discovery of the remains of Christopher Columbus in the Primate Cathedral of America, 
                    and while the mausoleum that would permanently house them was being built, Father Billini 
                    guarded and protected these remains in this church, safeguarding them in the crypt where, years 
                    later, he himself would be buried.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    But Regina Angelorum is not just a monument of the past: it is a living church, deeply integrated 
                    into the spiritual life of the city. It is also one of the favorite churches for brides. Dedicated to the 
                    Marian invocation of the Immaculate Conception, many couples who marry here do so with faith 
                    and the hope of receiving the blessing of their children. And, as those who return affirm with 
                    emotion, that blessing comes.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, under the custody of the Order of Malta, Regina Angelorum continues to be a space of 
                    deep spiritual recollection. Here, stone, wood and brick come together to create an atmosphere of 
                    sobriety and beauty, permeated by centuries of prayer, faith, fulfilled promises and new life.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before you head out, take a moment to gaze at this temple in silence. Regina Angelorum is not 
                    only a testimony of the past, but a place where history, faith and hope continue to meet.
